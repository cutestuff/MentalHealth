## Hack - Journaling

* Piece of Paper is enough
  * expensive notebook is fancy, but not necessary
  * I use Pink Pig from Amazon shop

* How to start
  * sit there with your thoughts, once you start they'll do their own magic
  * helps to make time for this, like drinking a tea at the same place every day, listen to the same music
 
* What it does
  * Forces you to slow down from about 67 thoughts/Second to the speed of writing
  * leads to you closing the circle
    * when you just think you're usually following parallel paths, seeing more problems and solutions and easily feel overwhelmed
  * you can go back and read what you thought on things

* Example, the ~ voice feels warm and friendly, while the one without is the active ego-part:
  * I'm not trying hard enough to get help, I don't want to work tomorrow
  * ~ why?
  * I'm scared to talk to my boss, and when asked I can't say that I've tried to get help every day, since I didn't try every day
  * ~ And then what?
  * You mean, we're considering self-harm because then we don't have to work?
  * ~ sounds reasonable, lol
  * Sarcasm doesn't help...
  * ~ One of these games that can only be won by tapping out, hu?
  * Head's empty now... thanks
  * ~ we should talk more often, see you later
  * What are you going to do?
  * ~ cruising through space, saving little brats from themselves
