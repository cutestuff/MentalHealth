# Hack Cleaning Your Room

there is no such thing as laziness, just priorities, either you don't really wanna do it, or you're intimidated by something around the thing, or you're depressed in which case you're just saving the energy for more relevant things.

* Check out Mari Kondo, while reading up you might get a few ideas, write them down
* High five yourself in the mirror
* Pick up 4 things - (5 won't work for me) - and put them where they belong - hopefully the same category: grab 4 pieces of dishes, put in the sink -repeat until no dishes left
* Break and play a videogame for 10 hrs
* Go hunting for the laundry xD
