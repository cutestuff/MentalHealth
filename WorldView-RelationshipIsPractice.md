# Worldview - Relationship is practice

We're all on a journey through time towards the end of life. On the way there's all kinds of suffering. We're rejected, we reject, we leave ourselves behind, we might gatherourselfes back up. That being said: everyone is on this road and hopefully will find some sense of happiness, or peace. 

* Radicalization.
  * The internet has radicalized a lot of us.
Keep talking to ppl, so you can learn to live with your differences. Cancel culture is bad for everybody. We're social creatures and divided we'll fall. When we're younger, we see everything we believe as truth and we throw it around as if there's something to win. Don't worry, loosing an argument won't break your identity, keep talking! Eventually you might find someone who's ready to tolerate you.

* Training.
  * if you want to start somewhere: show up at the same place every day. Staff can't run away, talk to them. Bring something to do in case nobody has time for you. I did some painting, drawing, writing in a notebook (bullet-journals are nice), ppl love talking to artists - that will come in time.
In time ppl will learn that you're reliable and maybe someone will tolerate you enough to hang out with you, and you get to spend some time with a side of yourself you didn't know yet - and maybe not be so alone inside your head.

* Trauma. 
  * For those of us with trauma, relationships are especially hard. Viewing it all as training helps me to not take everything so paeronal anymore. Esp. When someone stops talking to me, has become more bearable now.
