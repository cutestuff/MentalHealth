# Worldview - Relationship is practice

We're all on a journey through time towards the end of life. On the way there's all kinds of suffering. We're rejected, we reject, we leave ourselves behind, we might gatherourselfes back up. That being said: everyone is on this road and hopefully will find some sense of happiness, or peace. 

* Radicalization.
  * The internet has radicalized a lot of us.
Keep talking to ppl, so you can learn to live with your differences. Cancel culture is bad for everybody. We're social creatures and divided we'll fall. When we're younger, we see everything we believe as truth and we throw it around as if there's something to win. Don't worry, loosing an argument won't break your identity, keep talking! Eventually you might find someone who's ready to tolerate you.

* Trauma. 
  * For those of us with trauma, relationships are especially hard. Viewing it all as training helps me to not take everything so paeronal anymore. Esp. When someone stops talking to me, has become more bearable now.
