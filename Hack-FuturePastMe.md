# Hack Future, Past and Present Me

source: someone on reddit, about 10 years ago, damn time flies... 

Basically: you start treating your past like you treat any other person

* Past Self
  * our past self wasn't an idiot. He had his reasons, and he did the best he could, just like you do now.

* Present Self
  * You're not an idiot. You're still learning, like we all are. Life is complex shit and your ego tries to tell you it's easy, the difference can make you unhappy. That's why meditation, yoga, or even High Five in the Mirror are important. 
  * Everytime someone comes and tells you he's figured it all out, and whatever is easy to solve, he's selling some ointment for the pain. And hopeful like you are, you'll fall for it.
  * Show up for future you, put in some work: Make the bed, vacuum the floor, put out clothes for tomorrow, do the dishes, try Meal-Prep-Sunday

* When you show up for your future you, future you will have learned that she can rely on the past self, and hopefully, be less resentful towards the past.
